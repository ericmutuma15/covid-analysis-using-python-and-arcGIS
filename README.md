# covid-analysis-using-python-and-arcGIS
Python coding( pandas and geopandas libraries) on anaconda(spyder4) platform simple analytic codes + arcGIS analysis of the same dataset
This was actually my project which I did for my final year of undergrad in campus. What I did was collect covid 19 monthly data in kenya for 4 months for the purpose of time frame analysis of the same. I added a GIS vector layer of kenya and counties administrative boundaries to arcmap and edited the attributes of the layer to add my covid 19 data which I collected. 
I used ArcGIS 10.5 to generate thematic maps to best visualize value attributes of the dataset. This process is called symbology. Normalization ratios are useful to normalize data when other factors influence the numerical values you are classifying and displaying. Values in the normalization field are used to divide the value fields to create ratios. In this research, population, population density and area were used to normalize covid 19 data to see how they correlate.
